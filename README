Jessica,
In plugging your code into Genymotion emulator I found that the font didnâ€™t resize to the platform; however, it does run. So when it came to reading the content it was a bit small. The way that I was able to solve the resizing issue was not opening a default project, but opening a master file project. And then putting your app.js code in the Masterfile.js. 
The content was good, and I enjoyed the way that you laid out your information in a table format. It was both concise and professional. I am not aware if you put pictures within your code, but after looking at your code I saw the code lines where your pictures were, so I trust that they would pop up. Overall keep up the good work!
Best,
